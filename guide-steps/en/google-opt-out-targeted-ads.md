How to minimise targeted ads on social media: Google & Youtube

# Body #
Google dominates online search. The company also owns YouTube and Android, with the latter [reportedly](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/iphone-vs-android-market-share-3691861/) making up nearly 75% of the global smart phone market share. PI has [written](/node/2293) about the numerous problems that come from corporate concentration and the use of data by monopolistic companies, and there are numerous [examples](https://privacyinternational.org/corporateabusetimeline?tid=442) of Google's failure to protect its users.

Below is a set of steps you can take if you wish to minimise ad targeting when using Google.

1. Go to gmail.com and sign in
